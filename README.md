## Introduction

The PhoneMenuBar project is designed to improve the way users interact with the menu bar on their iOS devices. By leveraging Objective-C code, it allows for seamless integration and customization of the menu bar, making it more functional and user-friendly.

### Objective-C Snippet

Hereâ€™s a code snippet that illustrates how to make the menu bar visible:

```objc
(lldb) expr -l objc -i0 -O -- [[[[[[[SpringBoard sharedApplication] windowSceneManager] connectedWindowScenes] allObjects] firstObject] menuBarManager] setMenuBarVisible:0x1]
```

This command can be executed in a debugging session to toggle the visibility of the menu bar.
